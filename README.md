# Neogrowth

I have only the done the CRUD operations of the APIs using EF Core frmaework and backend is SQL Server. I didnt have much knowledge on React JS hence was not able to create the 
front end for the same.
Also only the relevant file i have added since Github has the restrictions of file size (25 MB) and no of files (100) to be uploaded with the open account.
